<p>My online alias is VRGuy. As the name suggests, my interest is in meddling with VR technologies.</p>
<p>I'm planning to start uploading public repos in the future. I'm very passionate about learning and tend to jump around a lot.</p>

<h3>My current projects:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Learning C++ at college</li>
</ul>
<h3>My project <i>'wishlist'</i>:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make my own VR headset and write simple software for it.</li>
<li>Learn Unity and unreal engine</li>
<li>Upload a stocker managing application to the app store by the end of 2025</li>
</ul>
